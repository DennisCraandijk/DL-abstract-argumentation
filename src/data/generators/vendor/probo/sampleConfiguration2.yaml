SOLVERS:
  - solvers/tweetysolver-v1.0.9.sh
  - solvers/tweetysolver-v1.1.1.sh
# ======================================================================
# all problems that are considered; only those solvers from above are
# evaluated wrt. the following problems that actually support them
PROBLEMS:
  - EE-PR
  - EE-CO
  - DS-CO
  - DC-GR

# ======================================================================
# the name of the file where the log of the benchmark run is saved
# (the log contains all executed calls, the output of each call, and the

# For the problem DC the number of randomly selected arguments each

# The timeout for each solver call (in seconds)  (default: 600)
TIMEOUT: 5
# ======================================================================
# The number of repetitions of each solver call; the final solving time
# for each call is the average over all calls, timeouts are ignored
# (default: 1)
REPETITIONS: 1

# Processes that might linger when a solver is timed out and should be
# killed after each timeout
