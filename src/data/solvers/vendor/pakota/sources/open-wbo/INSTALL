### INSTALL for the Open-WBO MaxSAT Solver

Open-WBO is compiled like MiniSAT. 
The option "s" statically compiles Open-WBO, and the option "r" compiles 
Open-WBO in release mode. For example:

# Compiles Open-WBO statically ("s") in release mode ("r")
make rs

# Compiles Open-WBO dynamically in debug mode
make


Any MiniSAT-like SAT solver may be used with Open-WBO. 
If you want to use a new SAT solver (e.g. "MiniSAT2.0"), it is necessary to 
crease a subdirectory (e.g. "minisat2.0") inside the "solvers" directory and 
change the Makefile accordingly:

# VERSION    = core or simp
# SOLVERNAME = name of the SAT solver
# SOLVERDIR  = subdirectory of the SAT solver
# NSPACE     = namespace of the SAT solver
#
# e.g. minisat compilation with core version:
#
# VERSION    = core
# SOLVERNAME = "Minisat"
# SOLVERDIR  = minisat
# NSPACE     = Minisat
#
VERSION    = core
SOLVERNAME = "MiniSAT2.0"
SOLVERDIR  = minisat2.0
NSPACE     = MiniSAT
# THE REMAINING OF THE MAKEFILE SHOULD BE LEFT UNCHANGED


The following SAT solvers are included in this version of Open-WBO: 
(i) minisat2.0, (ii) minisat2.2, (iii) glucose2.3, (iv) glucose3.0, (v) zenn, 
(vi) sinn, (vii) glueminisat, (viii) gluh, (ix) glue_bit, (x) glucored.


The above solvers can be quickly compiled by using the "compile.sh" script.

c USAGE: ./compile.sh [sat solver] (options)
c Options: debug, release (default: release)
c SAT solvers: minisat2.0, minisat2.2, glucose2.3, glucose3.0, zenn, sinn, glueminisat, gluh, glue_bit, glucored

For example, Glucose 3.0 can be compiled as follows.

# Compiles Glucose 3.0 in release mode
./compile.sh glucose3.0


The above solvers can be quickly clean by using the "clean.sh" script.

c USAGE: ./clean.sh [sat solver]
c SAT solvers: minisat2.0, minisat2.2, glucose2.3, glucose3.0, zenn, sinn, glueminisat, gluh, glue_bit, glucored, all

For example, Glucose 3.0 can be cleaned as follows.

# Cleans Glucose 3.0
./clean.sh glucose3.0
