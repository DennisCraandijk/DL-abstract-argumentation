### INSTALL for the Open-WBO MaxSAT Solver

Open-WBO is compiled like MiniSAT. 
The option "s" statically compiles Open-WBO, and the option "r" compiles 
Open-WBO in release mode. For example:

# Compiles Open-WBO statically ("s") in release mode ("r")
make rs

# Compiles Open-WBO dynamically in debug mode
make


Any MiniSAT-like SAT solver may be used with Open-WBO. 
If you want to use a new SAT solver (e.g. "MiniSAT2.0"), it is necessary to 
crease a subdirectory (e.g. "minisat2.0") inside the "solvers" directory and 
change the Makefile accordingly:

# VERSION    = core or simp
# SOLVERNAME = name of the SAT solver
# SOLVERDIR  = subdirectory of the SAT solver
# NSPACE     = namespace of the SAT solver
#
# e.g. minisat compilation with core version:
#
# VERSION    = core
# SOLVERNAME = "Minisat"
# SOLVERDIR  = minisat
# NSPACE     = Minisat
#
VERSION    = core
SOLVERNAME = "MiniSAT2.0"
SOLVERDIR  = minisat2.0
NSPACE     = MiniSAT
# THE REMAINING OF THE MAKEFILE SHOULD BE LEFT UNCHANGED


The following SAT solvers are included in this version of Open-WBO: 
(i) minisat2.2, (ii) glucose4.0, (iii) glucose4.1.
